                            <h2>Inala Shortage Sparks eBay Bidding Wars</h2>
                            <div class="time">15 June 2017</div>
                            <p>Shortages of popular lines of Inala running shoes in stores have prompted hoarding and top prices on eBay. Inala running shoes, sporting the Boost Technology, have become very popular in recent years. So popular, it seems that the company can hardly keep them on the shelves. Recent shortages have sent prices on eBay for a new pair of Inala running shoes, normally retailing for $115, up to an amazing $205 after intense bidding. The company has been accused of deliberately causing shortages of its own shoes. When contacted by the Associated Press, Inala's Chief Operating Officer, Gerard Forrester, said in an official statement that Inala is committed to producing as many high-quality shoes as the running public cares to purchase at competitive prices. He blamed the temporary shortage on supply chain issues. Inala has ramped up manufacturing at two of its Asian factories to make up for the shortage and hopes to have store shelves fully stocked by August.</p>

                            <h2>Fire in Adivas Shoe Factory in Bangalore, India, Injures 38 Workers</h2>
                            <div class="time">25 May 2017</div>
                            <p>A fire that broke out late in the work day yesterday at an Adivas factory in Bangalore, India, has injured 38 workers but, fortunately, caused no deaths. Local officials from the Department of Health and Safety are beginning an investigation to determine why these 38 workers, who suffered from second- and third-degree burns and smoke inhalation, were not able to exit the building more quickly. Many other employees who suffered only smoke inhalation were not included in the count of injured persons. None of the workers were willing to speak to the press. In an official statement to the press, Ravi Sharma, Chief of Operations for the factory, stated that all of the emergency exits and fire mitigation devices were in place and operational. However, a recent shipment of materials may have been blocking one of the exits closest to the fire. Mr. Sharma expresses his regret and condolences to the injured and their families and stated that Adivas is dedicated to providing safe workplaces for its valued employees.</p>

                            <div class="time">10 December 2017</div>
                            <p>A study completed recently at the University of Oklahoma has determined that running shoes can actually cause running injuries, and it recommends running barefoot or wearing only minimal foot protection. Researchers believe that the cushioning in running shoes does little to minimize the stresses caused by running, and in fact, it masks the pain that would allow runners to recognize the faults in their running posture that cause long-term wear and injury. Without the cushioning of the shoes, you would naturally change your stride and posture, long before chronic injury develops.</p>
