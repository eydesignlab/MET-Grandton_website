For different events and processions, we undertake risk assessments and look at ways of preventing breaches of peace and minimising serious disruption to the wider community. You can find out about how we help in the planning and policing of events and, if you’re organising an event, whether you need to notify us.</p></div></div><div class="tile item"><div class="inner"><h1>Hate crime</h1><p>With your help, we can deal with those responsible for hate crime and help to keep you and your communities safe.

Pub Watch schemes are local, independent groups formed of people working in licensed premises, while Country Watch schemes connect those living and working in rural parts of the country. Many of these schemes help us to cut crime and the opportunities for crime; they help and reassure those who live in the area and encourage neighbourliness and closer communities.</p><p>You can contact your local Watch Administrator for more information on how these schemes work, the benefits of the schemes and advice on running a scheme in your local area.</p></div></div></div></div></section><div class="footer clearfix"><p>The material provided is for educational purposes only.
